## What is Friend Finder?
Friend Finder is an app that aims to help you make new friends! Simply take a quick survey and your responses will match you up with someone based on how close your responses are. You will be abe to see name and a picture of your new friend!

## About:
This app uses both front end and back end technologies and combines them for a full stack program. A user is met with a landing page and will be redirected to another page using routes with help from the path npm. The user is then prompted to insert information that is taken and converted into a json object. That object is posted to an express server where it will be compared against data from an api that is retrieved using a get request. The user is then met with a pop up showing them their best match from the api data based off of the info provided.
